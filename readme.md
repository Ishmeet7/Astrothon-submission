### Problem Statement


Kushagra, a top class astronomer, lives in Betaverse, a universe parallel to ours
with the same physical laws. Kushagra lives on Zirca, a planet similar to earth in
Betaverse. Zirca completes one revolution around its star in 365 days. The only
difference in the betaverse is that it initially was expanding like our universe, but
later started to obey the steady state theory of the universe and the galaxies
which were moving, started moving at the speed it was when the transition
happened. Kushagra and his team find a galaxy about 3.26 million light years
away. They also find some interesting properties in that galaxy and want to study
it more. He also finds that the scale factor for this galaxy is 10. The size of the
observable betaverse w.r.t zirca is 3.3 million light years. *Find the time-period,
the zircans have to know more about this galaxy.
Write a general program to find the time for any galaxy and use the given values
as a test case.*

### Install required packages using:

!pip install astropy

### Notes

**Scale factor**
basically tells us how the universe is expanding or contracting.
